**1. Static Web Hosting**
AWS Amplify hosts static web resources including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files which are loaded in the user's browser.

**2. User Management**
Amazon Cognito provides user management and authentication functions to secure the backend API.

**3. Serverless Backend**
Amazon DynamoDB provides a persistence layer where data can be stored by the API's Lambda function.

**4. RESTful API**
JavaScript executed in the browser sends and receives data from a public backend API built using Lambda and API Gateway.
